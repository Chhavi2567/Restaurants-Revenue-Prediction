🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

📊 Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

🔢 Numpy: Numerical computations

📈 Matplotlib: Data visualization

📉 Seaborn: Statistical data visualization

🤖 Scikit-learn (Sklearn): Machine learning modeling and evaluation

🖊️ Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment

📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:
Restaurant Revenue Prediction Dataset

📜 Description

This dataset contains information about various restaurants and aims to predict the revenue based on several features. Each row represents a unique restaurant with various attributes that may influence its revenue.

🗂️ Columns

🍽️ Name: The name of the restaurant.
📍 Location: The location of the restaurant (e.g., Rural, Downtown).
🍴 Cuisine: The type of cuisine offered (e.g., Japanese, Mexican, Italian).
⭐ Rating: The average rating of the restaurant.
💺 Seating Capacity: The number of seats available in the restaurant.
💵 Average Meal Price: The average price of a meal at the restaurant.
📢 Marketing Budget: The marketing budget allocated for the restaurant.
📱 Social Media Followers: The number of social media followers.
👨‍🍳 Chef Experience Years: The number of years of experience of the head chef.
📝 Number of Reviews: The total number of reviews the restaurant has received.
✍️ Avg Review Length: The average length of reviews.
🎶 Ambience Score: A score representing the ambience of the restaurant.
🛎️ Service Quality Score: A score representing the quality of service.
🚗 Parking Availability: Indicates if parking is available (Yes/No).
📅 Weekend Reservations: The number of reservations made on weekends.
📆 Weekday Reservations: The number of reservations made on weekdays.
💰 Revenue: The total revenue generated by the restaurant.
