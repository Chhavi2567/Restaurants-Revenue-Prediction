Restaurants Revenue Prediction

Overview

This project focuses on predicting restaurant revenue using machine learning techniques. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression modeling, we aim to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making and improve the ability to forecast revenue effectively.

Tools & Libraries Used

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

Numpy: Numerical computations

Matplotlib: Data visualization

Seaborn: Statistical data visualization

Scikit-learn (Sklearn): Machine learning modeling and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:
Restaurant Revenue Prediction Dataset

Description

This dataset contains information about various restaurants and aims to predict the revenue based on several features. Each row represents a unique restaurant with various attributes that may influence its revenue.

Columns

Name: The name of the restaurant.

Location: The location of the restaurant (e.g., Rural, Downtown).

Cuisine: The type of cuisine offered (e.g., Japanese, Mexican, Italian).

Rating: The average rating of the restaurant.

Seating Capacity: The number of seats available in the restaurant.

Average Meal Price: The average price of a meal at the restaurant.

Marketing Budget: The marketing budget allocated for the restaurant.

Social Media Followers: The number of social media followers.

Chef Experience Years: The number of years of experience of the head chef.

Number of Reviews: The total number of reviews the restaurant has received.

Avg Review Length: The average length of reviews.

Ambience Score: A score representing the ambience of the restaurant.

Service Quality Score: A score representing the quality of service.

Parking Availability: Indicates if parking is available (Yes/No).

Weekend Reservations: The number of reservations made on weekends.

Weekday Reservations: The number of reservations made on weekdays.

Revenue: The total revenue generated by the restaurant.

Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified patterns and correlations within the dataset.

Visualized data to better understand distributions and relationships.

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

Handled missing values and outliers.

Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

Engineered new features to enhance predictive performance.

Regression Modeling:

Built multiple regression models to predict revenue.

Optimized model performance using hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Grid Search and Randomized Search.

Outcomes

Developed an optimized revenue prediction model with high accuracy.

Derived actionable insights for strategic planning in the restaurant industry.

Improved forecasting capabilities to assist in resource allocation and growth strategies.
